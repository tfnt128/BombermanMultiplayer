    : Its wings are too small to get its fat little body off the ground.  : The bee,
    of course, flies anyway  : because bees don''t care what humans think is impossible.
    BARRY BENSON: (Barry is picking out a shirt) Yellow, black. Yellow, black. Yellow,
    black. Yellow, black.  : Ooh, black and yellow! Let''s shake it up a little.

    - Hey, Adam. ADAM: - Hey, Barry. (Adam gets in Barry''s car)  : - Is that fuzz
    gel? BARRY: - A little. Special day, graduation. ADAM: Never thought I''d make

    not going to his funeral.  : Everybody knows, sting someone, you die.  : Don''t
    waste it on a squirrel. Such a hothead. ADAM: I guess he could have just gotten
    out of the way. (The car does a barrel roll on the loop-shaped bridge and lands
    on the highway)  : I love this incorporating an amusement park into our regular
    day. BARRY: I guess that''s why they say we don''t need vacations. (Barry parallel
    parks the car and together they fly over the graduating students) Boy, quite

    bee, have worked your whole life  : to get to the point where you can work for
    your whole life.  : Honey begins when our valiant Pollen Jocks bring the nectar
    to the hive.  : Our top-secret formula  : is automatically color-corrected, 
    scent-adjusted and bubble-contoured  : into this soothing sweet syrup  : with
    its distinctive golden glow you know as... EVERYONE ON BUS: Honey! (The guide
    has been collecting honey into a bottle and she throws it into the crowd on the
    bus and it is caught by a girl in the back) ADAM: - That girl was hot. BARRY:
    - She''s my cousin! ADAM== - She is? BARRY: - Yes, we''re all cousins. ADAM:
    - Right. You''re right. TOUR GUIDE: - At Honex, we constantly strive  : to improve
    every aspect of bee existence.  : These bees are stress-testing a new helmet
    technology. (The bus passes by a Bee wearing a helmet who is being smashed into
    the ground with fly-swatters, newspapers and boots. He lifts a thumbs up but
    you can hear him groan)  : ADAM==  - What do you think he makes? BARRY: - Not
    enough. TOUR GUIDE: Here we have our latest advancement, the Krelman. (They pass
    by a turning wheel with Bees standing on pegs, who are each wearing a finger-shaped
    hat) Barry: - Wow, What does that do? TOUR GUIDE: - Catches that little strand
    of honey  : that hangs after you pour it. Saves us millions. ADAM: (Intrigued)
    Can anyone work on the Krelman? TOUR GUIDE: Of course. Most bee jobs are small
    ones. But bees know that every small job, if it''s done well, means a lot.  :
    But choose carefully  : because you''ll stay in the job you pick for the rest
    of your life. (Everyone claps except for Barry) BARRY: The same job the rest
    of your life? I didn''t know that. ADAM:  What''s the difference? TOUR GUIDE:
    You''ll be happy to know that bees, as a species, haven''t had one day off  :
    in 27 million years. BARRY: (Upset) So you''ll just work us to death?  : We''ll
    sure try. (Everyone on the bus laughs except Barry. Barry and Adam are walking
    back home together) ADAM: Wow! That blew my mind! BARRY: "What''s the difference?"
    How can you say that?  : One job forever? That''s an insane choice to have to
    make. ADAM: I''m relieved. Now we only have to make one decision in life. BARRY:
    But, Adam, how could they never have told us that? ADAM: Why would you question
    anything? We''re bees.  : We''re the most perfectly functioning society on Earth. 
    BARRY: You ever think maybe things work a little too well here? ADAM: Like what?
    Give me one example. (Barry and Adam stop walking and it is revealed to the audience
    that hundreds of cars are speeding by and narrowly missing them in perfect unison)
    BARRY: I don''t know. But you know what I''m talking about. ANNOUNCER: Please
    clear the gate. Royal Nectar Force on approach. BARRY: Wait a second. Check it
    out. (The Pollen jocks fly in, circle around and landing in line)  : - Hey, those
    are Pollen Jocks! ADAM: - Wow.  : I''ve never seen them this close. BARRY: They
    know what it''s like outside the hive. ADAM: Yeah, but some don''t come back.
    GIRL BEES: - Hey, Jocks! - Hi, Jocks! (The Pollen Jocks hook up their backpacks
    to machines that pump the nectar to trucks, which drive away)  LOU LO DUVA: You
    guys did great!  : You''re monsters! You''re sky freaks! I love it! (Punching
    the Pollen Jocks in joy) I love it! ADAM: - I wonder where they were. BARRY:
    - I don''t know.  : Their day''s not planned.  : Outside the hive, flying who
    knows where, doing who knows what.  : You can''t just decide to be a Pollen Jock.
    You have to be bred for that. ADAM== Right. (Barry and Adam are covered in some
    pollen that floated off of the Pollen Jocks) BARRY: Look at that. That''s more
    pollen than you and I will see in a lifetime. ADAM: It''s just a status symbol.
    Bees make too much of it. BARRY: Perhaps. Unless you''re wearing it and the ladies
    see you wearing it. (Barry waves at 2 girls standing a little away from them) 
    ADAM== Those ladies? Aren''t they our cousins too? BARRY: Distant. Distant. POLLEN
    JOCK #1: Look at these two. POLLEN JOCK #2: - Couple of Hive Harrys. POLLEN JOCK
    #1: - Let''s have fun with them. GIRL BEE #1: It must be dangerous being a Pollen
    Jock. BARRY: Yeah. Once a bear pinned me against a mushroom!  : He had a paw
    on my throat, and with the other, he was slapping me! (Slaps Adam with his hand
    to represent his scenario) GIRL BEE #2: - Oh, my! BARRY: - I never thought I''d
    knock him out. GIRL BEE #1: (Looking at Adam) What were you doing during this?
    ADAM: Obviously I was trying to alert the authorities. BARRY: I can autograph
    that.  (The pollen jocks walk up to Barry and Adam, they pretend that Barry and
    Adam really are pollen jocks.) POLLEN JOCK #1: A little gusty out there today,
    wasn''t it, comrades? BARRY: Yeah. Gusty. POLLEN JOCK #1: We''re hitting a sunflower
    patch six miles from here tomorrow. BARRY: - Six miles, huh? ADAM: - Barry! POLLEN
    JOCK #2: A puddle jump for us, but maybe you''re not up for it. BARRY: - Maybe
    I am. ADAM: - You are not! POLLEN JOCK #1: We''re going 0900 at J-Gate.  : What
    do you think, buzzy-boy? Are you bee enough? BARRY: I might be. It all depends
    on what 0900 means. (The scene cuts to Barry looking out on the hive-city from
    his balcony at night) MARTIN:  Hey, Honex! BARRY: Dad, you surprised me. MARTIN:
    You decide what you''re interested in? BARRY: - Well, there''s a lot of choices.
    - But you only get one.  : Do you ever get bored doing the same job every day?
    MARTIN: Son, let me tell you about stirring.  : You grab that stick, and you
    just move it around, and you stir it around.  : You get yourself into a rhythm.
    It''s a beautiful thing. BARRY: You know, Dad, the more I think about it,  :
    maybe the honey field just isn''t right for me. MARTIN: You were thinking of
    what, making balloon animals?  : That''s a bad job for a guy with a stinger. 
    :  Janet, your son''s not sure he wants to go into honey! JANET: - Barry, you
    are so funny sometimes. BARRY: - I''m not trying to be funny. MARTIN: You''re
    not funny! You''re going into honey. Our son, the stirrer! JANET: - You''re gonna
    be a stirrer? BARRY: - No one''s listening to me! MARTIN: Wait till you see the
    sticks I have. BARRY: I could say anything right now. I''m gonna get an ant tattoo!
    (Barry''s parents don''t listen to him and continue to ramble on) MARTIN: Let''s
    open some honey and celebrate! BARRY: Maybe I''ll pierce my thorax. Shave my
    antennae.  : Shack up with a grasshopper. Get a gold tooth and call everybody
    "dawg"! JANET: I''m so proud. (The scene cuts to Barry and Adam waiting in line
    to get a job) ADAM: - We''re starting work today!  BARRY: - Today''s the day.
    ADAM: Come on! All the good jobs will be gone. BARRY: Yeah, right. JOB LISTER:
    Pollen counting, stunt bee, pouring, stirrer, front desk, hair removal... BEE
    IN FRONT OF LINE: - Is it still available? JOB LISTER: - Hang on. Two left! 
    : One of them''s yours! Congratulations! Step to the side. ADAM: - What''d you
    get? BEE IN FRONT OF LINE: - Picking crud out. Stellar! (He walks away) ADAM:
    Wow! JOB LISTER: Couple of newbies? ADAM: Yes, sir! Our first day! We are ready!
    JOB LISTER: Make your choice. (Adam and Barry look up at the job board. There
    are hundreds of constantly changing panels that contain available or unavailable
    jobs. It looks very confusing)  ADAM: - You want to go first? BARRY: - No, you
    go. ADAM: Oh, my. What''s available? JOB LISTER: Restroom attendant''s open,
    not for the reason you think. ADAM: - Any chance of getting the Krelman? JOB
    LISTER: - Sure, you''re on. (Puts the Krelman finger-hat on Adam''s head) (Suddenly
    the sign for Krelman closes out)  : I''m sorry, the Krelman just closed out.
    (Takes Adam''s hat off) Wax monkey''s always open. ADAM: The Krelman opened up
    again.  : What happened? JOB LISTER: A bee died. Makes an opening. See? He''s
    dead. Another dead one.  : Deady. Deadified. Two more dead.  : Dead from the
    neck up. Dead from the neck down. That''s life!  ADAM: Oh, this is so hard! (Barry
    remembers what the Pollen Jock offered him and he flies off) Heating, cooling,
    stunt bee, pourer, stirrer,  : humming, inspector number seven, lint coordinator,
    stripe supervisor,  : mite wrangler. Barry, what do you think I should... Barry?
    (Adam turns around and sees Barry flying away)  : Barry! POLLEN JOCK: All right,
    we''ve got the sunflower patch in quadrant nine... ADAM: (Through phone) What
    happened to you? Where are you? BARRY: - I''m going out. ADAM: - Out? Out where?
    BARRY: - Out there. ADAM: - Oh, no! BARRY: I have to, before I go to work for
    the rest of my life. ADAM:  You''re gonna die! You''re crazy! (Barry hangs up)
    Hello? POLLEN JOCK #2: Another call coming in.  : If anyone''s feeling brave,
    there''s a Korean deli on 83rd  : that gets their roses today. BARRY: Hey, guys.
    POLLEN JOCK #1 == - Look at that. POLLEN JOCK #2: - Isn''t that the kid we saw
    yesterday? LOU LO DUVA: Hold it, son, flight deck''s restricted. POLLEN JOCK
    #1: It''s OK, Lou. We''re gonna take him up. (Puts hand on Barry''s shoulder)
    LOU LO DUVA: (To Barry) Really? Feeling lucky, are you? BEE WITH CLIPBOARD: (To
    Barry) Sign here, here. Just initial that.  : - Thank you. LOU LO DUVA: - OK. 
    : You got a rain advisory today,  :  and as you all know, bees cannot fly in
    rain.  : So be careful. As always, watch your brooms,  : hockey sticks, dogs,
    birds, bears and bats.  : Also, I got a couple of reports of root beer being
    poured on us.  : Murphy''s in a home because of it, babbling like a cicada! BARRY:
    - That''s awful. LOU LO DUVA: (Still talking through megaphone) - And a reminder
    for you rookies,  : bee law number one, absolutely no talking to humans!  : All
    right, launch positions! POLLEN JOCKS: (The Pollen Jocks run into formation) 
    : Buzz, buzz, buzz, buzz! Buzz, buzz, buzz, buzz! Buzz, buzz, buzz, buzz! LOU
    LU DUVA: Black and yellow! POLLEN JOCKS:  Hello! POLLEN JOCK #1: (To Barry)You
    ready for this, hot shot? BARRY: Yeah. Yeah, bring it on. POLLEN JOCK''s: Wind,
    check.  : - Antennae, check. - Nectar pack, check.  : - Wings, check. - Stinger,
    check. BARRY: Scared out of my shorts, check. LOU LO DUVA: OK, ladies,  : let''s
    move it out!  : Pound those petunias, you striped stem-suckers!  : All of you,
    drain those flowers! (The pollen jocks fly out of the hive) BARRY: Wow! I''m
    out!  : I can''t believe I''m out!  : So blue.   : I feel so fast and free! 
    : Box kite! (Barry flies through the kite)  : Wow!  : Flowers! (A pollen jock
    puts on some high tech goggles that shows flowers similar to heat sink goggles.)
    POLLEN JOCK: This is Blue Leader. We have roses visual.  : Bring it around 30
    degrees and hold.  : Roses! POLLEN JOCK #1: 30 degrees, roger. Bringing it around. 
    : Stand to the side, kid. It''s got a bit of a kick. (The pollen jock fires a
    high-tech gun at the flower, shooting tubes that suck up the nectar from the
    flower and collects it into a pouch on the gun) BARRY: That is one nectar collector!
    POLLEN JOCK #1== - Ever see pollination up close? BARRY: - No, sir. POLLEN JOCK
    #1:  (Barry and the Pollen jock fly over the field, the pollen jock sprinkles
    pollen as he goes)  : I pick up some pollen here, sprinkle it over here. Maybe
    a dash over there,  : a pinch on that one. See that? It''s a little bit of magic.
    BARRY: That''s amazing. Why do we do that? POLLEN JOCK #1: That''s pollen power.
    More pollen, more flowers, more nectar, more honey for us. BARRY: Cool. POLLEN
    JOCK #1: I''m picking up a lot of bright yellow. could be daisies. Don''t we
    need those? POLLEN JOCK #2: Copy that visual.  : Wait. One of these flowers seems
    to be on the move. POLLEN JOCK #1: Say again? You''re reporting a moving flower?
    POLLEN JOCK #2: Affirmative. (The Pollen jocks land near the "flowers" which,
    to the audience are obviously just tennis balls) KEN: (In the distance) That
    was on the line!  POLLEN JOCK #1: This is the coolest. What is it? POLLEN JOCK
    #2: I don''t know, but I''m loving this color.  : It smells good. Not like a
    flower, but I like it. POLLEN JOCK #1: Yeah, fuzzy. (Sticks his hand on the ball
    but it gets stuck) POLLEN JOCK #3== Chemical-y. (The pollen jock finally gets
    his hand free from the tennis ball) POLLEN JOCK #1: Careful, guys. It''s a little
    grabby. (The pollen jocks turn around and see Barry lying his entire body on
    top of one of the tennis balls) POLLEN JOCK #2: My sweet lord of bees! POLLEN
    JOCK #3: Candy-brain, get off there! POLLEN JOCK #1: (Pointing upwards) Problem!
    (A human hand reaches down and grabs the tennis ball that Barry is stuck to)
    BARRY: - Guys! POLLEN JOCK #2: - This could be bad. POLLEN JOCK #3: Affirmative.
    (Vanessa Bloome starts bouncing the tennis ball, not knowing Barry is stick to
    it)  BARRY== Very close.  : Gonna hurt.  : Mama''s little boy. (Barry is being
    hit back and forth by two humans playing tennis. He is still stuck to the ball)
    POLLEN JOCK #1: You are way out of position, rookie! KEN: Coming in at you like
    a MISSILE! (Barry flies past the pollen jocks, still stuck to the ball) BARRY:
    (In slow motion) Help me! POLLEN JOCK #2: I don''t think these are flowers. POLLEN
    JOCK #3: - Should we tell him? POLLEN JOCK #1: - I think he knows. BARRY: What
    is this?! KEN: Match point!  : You can start packing up, honey, because you''re
    about to EAT IT! (A pollen jock coughs which confused Ken and he hits the ball
    the wrong way with Barry stuck to it and it goes flying into the city) BARRY: 
    Yowser! (Barry bounces around town and gets stuck in the engine of a car. He
    flies into the air conditioner and sees a bug that was frozen in there) BARRY:
    Ew, gross. (The man driving the car turns on the air conditioner which blows
    Barry into the car) GIRL IN CAR: There''s a bee in the car!  : - Do something!
    DAD DRIVING CAR: - I''m driving! BABY GIRL: (Waving at Barry) - Hi, bee. (Barry
    smiles and waves at the baby girl) GUY IN BACK OF CAR: - He''s back here!  :
    He''s going to sting me! GIRL IN CAR: Nobody move. If you don''t move, he won''t
    sting you. Freeze! (Barry freezes as well, hovering in the middle of the car) 
    : GRANDMA IN CAR== He blinked! (The grandma whips out some bee-spray and sprays
    everywhere in the car, climbing into the front seat, still trying to spray Barry)
    GIRL IN CAR: Spray him, Granny! DAD DRIVING THE CAR: What are you doing?! (Barry
    escapes the car through the air conditioner and is flying high above  the ground,
    safe.) BARRY: Wow... the tension level out here is unbelievable. (Barry sees
    that storm clouds are gathering and he can see rain clouds moving into this direction) 
    : I gotta get home.  : Can''t fly in rain.  : Can''t fly in rain. (A rain drop
    hits Barry and one of his wings is damaged)  : Can''t fly in rain. (A second
    rain drop hits Barry again and he spirals downwards) Mayday! Mayday! Bee going
    down! (WW2 plane sound effects are played as he plummets, and he crash-lands
    on a plant inside an apartment near the window) VANESSA BLOOME: Ken, could you
    close the window please? KEN== Hey, check out my new resume. I made it into a
    fold-out brochure.  : You see? (Folds brochure resume out) Folds out. (Ken closes
    the window, trapping Barry inside) BARRY: Oh, no. More humans. I don''t need
    this. (Barry tries to fly away but smashes into the window and falls again) 
    : What was that?  (Barry keeps trying to fly out the window but he keeps being
    knocked back because the window is closed) Maybe this time. This time. This time.
    This time! This time! This...  : Drapes! (Barry taps the glass. He doesn''t understand
    what it is) That is diabolical. KEN: It''s fantastic. It''s got all my special
    skills, even my top-ten favorite movies. ANDY: What''s number one? Star Wars?
    KEN: Nah, I don''t go for that... (Ken makes finger guns and makes "pew pew pew"
    sounds and then stops)  : ...kind of stuff. BARRY: No wonder we shouldn''t talk
    to them. They''re out of their minds. KEN: When I leave a job interview, they''re
    flabbergasted, can''t believe what I say. BARRY: (Looking at the light on the
    ceiling) There''s the sun. Maybe that''s a way out. (Starts flying towards the
    lightbulb)  : I don''t remember the sun having a big 75 on it. (Barry hits the
    lightbulb and falls into the dip on the table that the humans are sitting at)
    KEN:  I predicted global warming.  : I could feel it getting hotter. At first
    I thought it was just me. (Andy dips a chip into the bowl and scoops up some
    dip with Barry on it and is about to put it in his mouth)  : Wait! Stop! Bee!
    (Andy drops the chip with Barry in fear and backs away. All the humans freak
    out)  : Stand back. These are winter boots. (Ken has winter boots on his hands
    and he is about to smash the bee but Vanessa saves him last second) VANESSA:
    Wait!  : Don''t kill him! (Vanessa puts Barry in a glass to protect him) KEN:
    You know I''m allergic to them! This thing could kill me! VANESSA: Why does his
    life have less value than yours? KEN: Why does his life have any less value than
    mine? Is that your statement? VANESSA: I''m just saying all life has value. You
    don''t know what he''s capable of feeling. (Vanessa picks up Ken''s brochure
    and puts it under the glass so she can carry Barry back to the window. Barry
    looks at Vanessa in amazement) KEN:  My brochure! VANESSA: There you go, little
    guy. (Vanessa opens the window and lets Barry out but Barry stays back and is
    still shocked that a human saved his life) KEN: I''m not scared of him. It''s
    an allergic thing. VANESSA: Put that on your resume brochure. KEN: My whole face
    could puff up. ANDY: Make it one of your special skills. KEN: Knocking someone
    out is also a special skill. (Ken walks to the door) Right. Bye, Vanessa. Thanks. 
    : - Vanessa, next week? Yogurt night? VANESSA: - Sure, Ken. You know, whatever. 
    : (Vanessa tries to close door) KEN== - You could put carob chips on there. VANESSA:
    - Bye. (Closes door but Ken opens it again) KEN: - Supposed to be less calories. 
    VANESSA: - Bye. (Closes door) (Fast forward to the next day, Barry is still inside
    the house. He flies into the kitchen where Vanessa is doing dishes) BARRY== (Talking
    to himself) I gotta say something.  : She saved my life. I gotta say something. 
    : All right, here it goes. (Turns back) Nah.  : What would I say?  : I could
    really get in trouble.  : It''s a bee law. You''re not supposed to talk to a
    human.  : I can''t believe I''m doing this.  : I''ve got to. (Barry disguises
    himself as a character on a food can as Vanessa walks by again)  : Oh, I can''t
    do it. Come on!  : No. Yes. No.  : Do it. I can''t.   : How should I start it?
    (Barry strikes a pose and wiggles his eyebrows) "You like jazz?" No, that''s
    no good. (Vanessa is about to walk past Barry) Here she comes! Speak, you fool! 
    : ...Hi! (Vanessa gasps and drops the dishes in fright and notices Barry on the
    counter)  : I''m sorry. VANESSA: - You''re talking. BARRY: - Yes, I know. VANESSA:
    (Pointing at Barry) You''re talking! BARRY: I''m so sorry. VANESSA: No, it''s
    OK. It''s fine. I know I''m dreaming.  : But I don''t recall going to bed. BARRY:
    Well, I''m sure this is very disconcerting. VANESSA: This is a bit of a surprise
    to me. I mean, you''re a bee!  BARRY: I am. And I''m not supposed to be doing
    this, (Pointing to the living room where Ken tried to kill him last night) but
    they were all trying to kill me.  : And if it wasn''t for you...  : I had to
    thank you. It''s just how I was raised. (Vanessa stabs her hand with a fork to
    test whether she''s dreaming or not)  : That was a little weird. VANESSA: - I''m
    talking with a bee. BARRY: - Yeah. VANESSA: I''m talking to a bee. And the bee
    is talking to me! BARRY: I just want to say I''m grateful. I''ll leave now. (Barry
    turns to leave) VANESSA: - Wait! How did you learn to do that? BARRY: (Flying
    back) - What? VANESSA: The talking...thing. BARRY:  Same way you did, I guess.
    "Mama, Dada, honey." You pick it up. VANESSA: - That''s very funny. BARRY: -
    Yeah.  : Bees are funny. If we didn''t laugh, we''d cry with what we have to
    deal with.  : Anyway... VANESSA: Can I...  : ...get you something? BARRY: - Like
    what? VANESSA: I don''t know. I mean... I don''t know. Coffee? BARRY: I don''t
    want to put you out. VANESSA: It''s no trouble. It takes two minutes.  : - It''s
    just coffee. BARRY: - I hate to impose. (Vanessa starts making coffee) VANESSA:
    - Don''t be ridiculous!  BARRY: - Actually, I would love a cup. VANESSA: Hey,
    you want rum cake? BARRY: - I shouldn''t. VANESSA: - Have some. BARRY: - No,
    I can''t. VANESSA: - Come on! BARRY: I''m trying to lose a couple micrograms.
    VANESSA: - Where? BARRY: - These stripes don''t help. VANESSA: You look great!
    BARRY: I don''t know if you know anything about fashion.  : Are you all right?
    VANESSA: (Pouring coffee on the floor and missing the cup completely) No. (Flash
    forward in time. Barry and Vanessa are sitting together at a table on top of
    the apartment building drinking coffee)   : BARRY== He''s making the tie in the
    cab as they''re flying up Madison.  : He finally gets there.  : He runs up the
    steps into the church. The wedding is on.  : And he says, "Watermelon? I thought
    you said Guatemalan.  : Why would I marry a watermelon?" (Barry laughs but Vanessa
    looks confused) VANESSA: Is that a bee joke? BARRY: That''s the kind of stuff
    we do. VANESSA: Yeah, different.  : So, what are you gonna do, Barry? (Barry
    stands on top of a sugar cube floating in his coffee and paddles it around with
    a straw like it''s a gondola) BARRY: About work? I don''t know.  : I want to
    do my part for the hive, but I can''t do it the way they want. VANESSA: I know
    how you feel.  BARRY: - You do? VANESSA: - Sure.  : My parents wanted me to be
    a lawyer or a doctor, but I wanted to be a florist. BARRY: - Really? VANESSA:
    - My only interest is flowers. BARRY: Our new queen was just elected with that
    same campaign slogan.  : Anyway, if you look... (Barry points to a tree in the
    middle of Central Park)  : There''s my hive right there. See it? VANESSA: You''re
    in Sheep Meadow! BARRY: Yes! I''m right off the Turtle Pond! VANESSA: No way!
    I know that area. I lost a toe ring there once. BARRY: - Why do girls put rings
    on their toes? VANESSA: - Why not? BARRY:  - It''s like putting a hat on your
    knee. VANESSA: - Maybe I''ll try that. (A custodian installing a lightbulb looks
    over at them but to his perspective it looks like Vanessa is talking to a cup
    of coffee on the table) CUSTODIAN: - You all right, ma''am? VANESSA: - Oh, yeah.
    Fine.  : Just having two cups of coffee! BARRY: Anyway, this has been great.
    Thanks for the coffee. VANESSA== Yeah, it''s no trouble. BARRY: Sorry I couldn''t
    finish it. If I did, I''d be up the rest of my life. (Barry points towards the
    rum cake)  : Can I take a piece of this with me? VANESSA: Sure! Here, have a
    crumb. (Vanessa hands Barry a crumb but it is still pretty big for Barry) BARRY:
    - Thanks! VANESSA: - Yeah. BARRY: All right. Well, then... I guess I''ll see
    you around.   : Or not. VANESSA: OK, Barry... BARRY: And thank you so much again...
    for before. VANESSA: Oh, that? That was nothing. BARRY: Well, not nothing, but...
    Anyway... (Vanessa and Barry hold hands, but Vanessa has to hold out a finger
    because her hands is to big and Barry holds that) (The custodian looks over again
    and it appears Vanessa is laughing at her coffee again. The lightbulb that he
    was screwing in sparks and he falls off the ladder) (Fast forward in time and
    we see two Bee Scientists testing out a parachute in a Honex wind tunnel) BEE
    SCIENTIST #1: This can''t possibly work. BEE SCIENTIST #2: He''s all set to go.
    We may as well try it.  : OK, Dave, pull the chute. (Dave pulls the chute and
    the wind slams him against the wall and he falls on his face.The camera pans
    over and we see Barry and Adam walking together) ADAM: - Sounds amazing. BARRY:
    - It was amazing!  : It was the scariest, happiest moment of my life.  ADAM:
    Humans! I can''t believe you were with humans!  : Giant, scary humans! What were
    they like? BARRY: Huge and crazy. They talk crazy.  : They eat crazy giant things.
    They drive crazy. ADAM: - Do they try and kill you, like on TV? BARRY: - Some
    of them. But some of them don''t. ADAM: - How''d you get back? BARRY: - Poodle.
    ADAM: You did it, and I''m glad. You saw whatever you wanted to see.  : You had
    your "experience." Now you can pick out your job and be normal. BARRY: - Well...
    ADAM: - Well? BARRY: Well, I met someone.  ADAM: You did? Was she Bee-ish?  :
    - A wasp?! Your parents will kill you! BARRY: - No, no, no, not a wasp. ADAM:
    - Spider? BARRY: - I''m not attracted to spiders.  : I know, for everyone else,
    it''s the hottest thing, with the eight legs and all.  : I can''t get by that
    face. ADAM: So who is she? BARRY: She''s... human. ADAM: No, no. That''s a bee
    law. You wouldn''t break a bee law. BARRY: - Her name''s Vanessa. (Adam puts
    his head in his hands) ADAM: - Oh, boy. BARRY== She''s so nice. And she''s a
    florist! ADAM: Oh, no! You''re dating a human florist!  BARRY: We''re not dating.
    ADAM: You''re flying outside the hive, talking to humans that attack our homes 
    : with power washers and M-80s! That''s one-eighth a stick of dynamite! BARRY:
    She saved my life! And she understands me. ADAM: This is over! BARRY: Eat this.
    (Barry gives Adam a piece of the crumb that he got from Vanessa. Adam eats it)
    ADAM: (Adam''s tone changes) This is not over! What was that? BARRY: - They call
    it a crumb. ADAM: - It was so stingin'' stripey! BARRY: And that''s not what
    they eat. That''s what falls off what they eat!  : - You know what a Cinnabon
    is? ADAM: - No. (Adam opens a door behind him and he pulls Barry in)  BARRY:
    It''s bread and cinnamon and frosting. ADAM: Be quiet! BARRY: They heat it up...
    ADAM: Sit down! (Adam forces Barry to sit down) BARRY: (Still rambling about
    Cinnabons) ...really hot! (Adam grabs Barry by the shoulders) ADAM: - Listen
    to me!  : We are not them! We''re us. There''s us and there''s them! BARRY==
    Yes, but who can deny the heart that is yearning? ADAM: There''s no yearning.
    Stop yearning. Listen to me!  : You have got to start thinking bee, my friend.
    Thinking bee! BARRY: - Thinking bee. WORKER BEE: - Thinking bee. WORKER BEES
    AND ADAM: Thinking bee! Thinking bee!  Thinking bee! Thinking bee! (Flash forward
    in time; Barry is laying on a raft in a pool full of honey. He is wearing sunglasses)
    JANET: There he is. He''s in the pool. MARTIN: You know what your problem is,
    Barry? (Barry pulls down his sunglasses and he looks annoyed) BARRY: (Sarcastic)
    I gotta start thinking bee? JANET: How much longer will this go on? MARTIN: It''s
    been three days! Why aren''t you working? (Puts sunglasses back on) BARRY: I''ve
    got a lot of big life decisions to think about. MARTIN: What life? You have no
    life! You have no job. You''re barely a bee! JANET: Would it kill you to make
    a little honey? (Barry rolls off the raft and sinks into the honey pool)  : Barry,
    come out. Your father''s talking to you.  : Martin, would you talk to him? MARTIN: 
    Barry, I''m talking to you! (Barry keeps sinking into the honey until he is suddenly
    in Central Park having a picnic with Vanessa) (Barry has a cup of honey and he
    clinks his glass with Vanessas. Suddenly a mosquito lands on Vanessa and she
    slaps it, killing it. They both gasp but then burst out laughing) VANESSA: You
    coming? (The camera pans over and Vanessa is climbing into a small yellow airplane)
    BARRY: Got everything? VANESSA: All set! BARRY: Go ahead. I''ll catch up. (Vanessa
    lifts off and flies ahead) VANESSA: Don''t be too long. (Barry catches up with
    Vanessa and he sticks out his arms like ana irplane. He rolls from side to side,
    and Vanessa copies him with the airplane) VANESSA: Watch this! (Barry stays back
    and watches as Vanessa draws a heart in the air using pink smoke from the plane,
    but on the last loop-the-loop she suddenly crashes into a mountain and the plane
    explodes. The destroyed plane falls into some rocks and explodes a second time)
    BARRY: Vanessa! (As Barry is yelling his mouth fills with honey and he wakes
    up, discovering that he was just day dreaming. He slowly sinks back into the
    honey pool) MARTIN: - We''re still here.  JANET: - I told you not to yell at
    him.  : He doesn''t respond to yelling! MARTIN: - Then why yell at me? JANET:
    - Because you don''t listen! MARTIN: I''m not listening to this. BARRY: Sorry,
    I''ve gotta go. MARTIN: - Where are you going? BARRY: - I''m meeting a friend.
    JANET: A girl? Is this why you can''t decide? BARRY: Bye. (Barry flies out the
    door and Martin shakes his head)  : JANET== I just hope she''s Bee-ish. (Fast
    forward in time and Barry is sitting on Vanessa''s shoulder and she is closing
    up her shop) BARRY: They have a huge parade of flowers every year in Pasadena?
    VANESSA: To be in the Tournament of Roses, that''s every florist''s dream!  
    : Up on a float, surrounded by flowers, crowds cheering. BARRY: A tournament.
    Do the roses compete in athletic events? VANESSA: No. All right, I''ve got one.
    How come you don''t fly everywhere? BARRY: It''s exhausting. Why don''t you run
    everywhere? It''s faster. VANESSA: Yeah, OK, I see, I see. All right, your turn.
    BARRY: TiVo. You can just freeze live TV? That''s insane! VANESSA: You don''t
    have that? BARRY: We have Hivo, but it''s a disease. It''s a horrible, horrible
    disease. VANESSA: Oh, my. (A human walks by and Barry narrowly avoids him) PASSERBY:
    Dumb bees! VANESSA: You must want to sting all those jerks. BARRY: We try not
    to sting.  It''s usually fatal for us. VANESSA: So you have to watch your temper
    (They walk into a store) BARRY: Very carefully. You kick a wall, take a walk, 
    : write an angry letter and throw it out. Work through it like any emotion: 
    : Anger, jealousy, lust. (Suddenly an employee(Hector) hits Barry off of Vanessa''s
    shoulder. Hector thinks he''s saving Vanessa) VANESSA: (To Barry) Oh, my goodness!
    Are you OK? (Barry is getting up off the floor) BARRY: Yeah. VANESSA: (To Hector)
    - What is wrong with you?! HECTOR: (Confused) - It''s a bug. VANESSA: He''s not
    bothering anybody. Get out of here, you creep! (Vanessa hits Hector across the
    face with the magazine he had and then hits him in the head. Hector backs away
    covering his head) Barry: What was that? A Pic ''N'' Save circular? (Vanessa
    sets Barry back on her shoulder)  VANESSA: Yeah, it was. How did you know? BARRY:
    It felt like about 10 pages. Seventy-five is pretty much our limit. VANESSA:
    You''ve really got that down to a science. BARRY: - Oh, we have to. I lost a
    cousin to Italian Vogue. VANESSA: - I''ll bet. (Barry looks to his right and
    notices there is honey for sale in the aisle) BARRY: What in the name of Mighty
    Hercules is this? (Barry looks at all the brands of honey, shocked) How did this
    get here? Cute Bee, Golden Blossom,  : Ray Liotta Private Select? (Barry puts
    his hands up and slowly turns around, a look of disgust on his face) VANESSA:
    - Is he that actor? BARRY: - I never heard of him.  : - Why is this here? VANESSA:
    - For people. We eat it. BARRY:  You don''t have enough food of your own?! (Hector
    looks back and notices that Vanessa is talking to Barry) VANESSA: - Well, yes.
    BARRY: - How do you get it? VANESSA: - Bees make it. BARRY: - I know who makes
    it!  : And it''s hard to make it!  : There''s heating, cooling, stirring. You
    need a whole Krelman thing! VANESSA: - It''s organic. BARRY: - It''s our-ganic!
    VANESSA: It''s just honey, Barry. BARRY: Just what?!  : Bees don''t know about
    this! This is stealing! A lot of stealing!  : You''ve taken our homes, schools,
    hospitals! This is all we have!  :  And it''s on sale?! I''m getting to the bottom
    of this.  : I''m getting to the bottom of all of this! (Flash forward in time;
    Barry paints his face with black strikes like a soldier and sneaks into the storage
    section of the store) (Two men, including Hector, are loading boxes into some
    trucks)  : SUPERMARKET EMPLOYEE== Hey, Hector.  : - You almost done? HECTOR:
    - Almost. (Barry takes a step to peak around the corner) (Whispering) He is here.
    I sense it.  : Well, I guess I''ll go home now (Hector pretends to walk away
    by walking in place and speaking loudly)  : and just leave this nice honey out,
    with no one around. BARRY: You''re busted, box boy! HECTOR: I knew I heard something!
    So you can talk! BARRY: I can talk. And now you''ll start talking!  : Where you
    getting the sweet stuff?  Who''s your supplier? HECTOR: I don''t understand.
    I thought we were friends.  : The last thing we want to do is upset bees! (Hector
    takes a thumbtack out of the board behind him and sword-fights Barry. Barry is
    using his stinger like a sword)  : You''re too late! It''s ours now! BARRY: You,
    sir, have crossed the wrong sword! HECTOR: You, sir, will be lunch for my iguana,
    Ignacio! (Barry hits the thumbtack out of Hectors hand and Hector surrenders)
    Barry: Where is the honey coming from?  : Tell me where! HECTOR: (Pointing to
    leaving truck) Honey Farms! It comes from Honey Farms! (Barry chases after the
    truck but it is getting away. He flies onto a bicyclists'' backpack and he catches
    up to the truck) CAR DRIVER: (To bicyclist) Crazy person! (Barry flies off and
    lands on the windshield of the Honey farms truck. Barry looks around and sees
    dead bugs splattered everywhere) BARRY: What horrible thing has happened here?  
    : These faces, they never knew what hit them. And now  : they''re on the road
    to nowhere! (Barry hears a sudden whisper) (Barry looks up and sees Mooseblood,
    a mosquito playing dead) MOOSEBLOOD: Just keep still. BARRY: What? You''re not
    dead? MOOSEBLOOD: Do I look dead? They will wipe anything that moves. Where you
    headed? BARRY: To Honey Farms. I am onto something huge here. MOOSEBLOOD: I''m
    going to Alaska. Moose blood, crazy stuff. Blows your head off! ANOTHER BUG PLAYING
    DEAD: I''m going to Tacoma. (Barry looks at another bug) BARRY: - And you? MOOSEBLOOD:
    - He really is dead. BARRY: All right. (Another bug hits the windshield and the
    drivers notice. They activate the windshield wipers) MOOSEBLOOD== Uh-oh! (The
    windshield wipers are slowly sliding over the dead bugs and wiping  them off)
    BARRY: - What is that?! MOOSEBLOOD: - Oh, no!  : - A wiper! Triple blade! BARRY:
    - Triple blade? MOOSEBLOOD: Jump on! It''s your only chance, bee! (Mooseblood
    and Barry grab onto the wiper and they hold on as it wipes the windshield) Why
    does everything have to be so doggone clean?!  : How much do you people need
    to see?! (Bangs on windshield)  : Open your eyes! Stick your head out the window!
    RADIO IN TRUCK: From NPR News in Washington, I''m Carl Kasell. MOOSEBLOOD: But
    don''t kill no more bugs! (Mooseblood and Barry are washed off by the wipr fluid)
    MOOSEBLOOD: - Bee! BARRY: - Moose blood guy!! (Barry starts screaming as he hangs
    onto the antenna) (Suddenly it is revealed that a water bug is also hanging on
    the antenna.  There is a pause and then Barry and the water bug both start screaming)
    TRUCK DRIVER: - You hear something? GUY IN TRUCK: - Like what? TRUCK DRIVER:
    Like tiny screaming. GUY IN TRUCK: Turn off the radio. (The antenna starts to
    lower until it gets to low and sinks into the truck. The water bug flies off
    and Barry is forced to let go and he is blown away. He luckily lands inside a
    horn on top of the truck where he finds Mooseblood, who was blown into the same
    place) MOOSEBLOOD: Whassup, bee boy? BARRY: Hey, Blood. (Fast forward in time
    and we see that Barry is deep in conversation with Mooseblood. They have been
    sitting in this truck for a while) BARRY: ...Just a row of honey jars, as far
    as the eye could see. MOOSEBLOOD: Wow! BARRY: I assume wherever this truck goes
    is where they''re getting it.  : I mean, that honey''s ours. MOOSEBLOOD: - Bees
    hang tight. BARRY:  - We''re all jammed in.  : It''s a close community. MOOSEBLOOD:
    Not us, man. We on our own. Every mosquito on his own. BARRY: - What if you get
    in trouble? MOOSEBLOOD: - You a mosquito, you in trouble.  : Nobody likes us.
    They just smack. See a mosquito, smack, smack! BARRY: At least you''re out in
    the world. You must meet girls. MOOSEBLOOD: Mosquito girls try to trade up, get
    with a moth, dragonfly.  : Mosquito girl don''t want no mosquito. (An ambulance
    passes by and it has a blood donation sign on it) You got to be kidding me! 
    : Mooseblood''s about to leave the building! So long, bee! (Mooseblood leaves
    and flies onto the window of the ambulance where there are other mosquito''s
    hanging out)  : - Hey, guys! OTHER MOSQUITO: - Mooseblood!  MOOSEBLOOD: I knew
    I''d catch y''all down here. Did you bring your crazy straw? (The truck goes
    out of view and Barry notices that the truck he''s on is pulling into a camp
    of some sort) TRUCK DRIVER: We throw it in jars, slap a label on it, and it''s
    pretty much pure profit. (Barry flies out) BARRY: What is this place? BEEKEEPER
    1#: A bee''s got a brain the size of a pinhead. BEEKEEPER #2: They are pinheads! 
    : Pinhead.  : - Check out the new smoker. BEEKEEPER #1: - Oh, sweet. That''s
    the one you want.  : The Thomas 3000! BARRY: Smoker? BEEKEEPER #1: Ninety puffs
    a minute, semi-automatic. Twice the nicotine, all the tar.  : A couple breaths
    of this knocks them right out.  BEEKEEPER #2: They make the honey, and we make
    the money. BARRY: "They make the honey, and we make the money"? (The Beekeeper
    sprays hundreds of cheap miniature apartments with the smoker. The bees are fainting
    or passing out) Oh, my!  : What''s going on? Are you OK? (Barry flies into one
    of the apartment and helps a Bee couple get off the ground. They are coughing
    and its hard for them to stand) BEE IN APARTMENT: Yeah. It doesn''t last too
    long. BARRY: Do you know you''re in a fake hive with fake walls? BEE IN APPARTMENT:
    Our queen was moved here. We had no choice. (The apartment room is completely
    empty except for a photo on the wall of the "queen" who is obviously a man in
    women''s clothes) BARRY: This is your queen? That''s a man in women''s clothes! 
    : That''s a drag queen!  : What is this? (Barry flies out and he discovers that
    there are hundreds of these structures, each housing thousands of Bees) Oh, no! 
    : There''s hundreds of them! (Barry takes out his camera and takes pictures of
    these Bee work camps. The beekeepers look very evil in these depictions)  Bee
    honey.  : Our honey is being brazenly stolen on a massive scale!  : This is worse
    than anything bears have done! I intend to do something. (Flash forward in time
    and Barry is showing these pictures to his parents) JANET: Oh, Barry, stop. MARTIN:
    Who told you humans are taking our honey? That''s a rumor. BARRY: Do these look
    like rumors? (Holds up the pictures) UNCLE CARL: That''s a conspiracy theory.
    These are obviously doctored photos. JANET: How did you get mixed up in this?
    ADAM: He''s been talking to humans. JANET: - What? MARTIN: - Talking to humans?!
    ADAM: He has a human girlfriend. And they make out! JANET: Make out? Barry! 
    BARRY: We do not. ADAM: - You wish you could. MARTIN: - Whose side are you on?
    BARRY: The bees! UNCLE CARL: (He has been sitting in the back of the room this
    entire time) I dated a cricket once in San Antonio. Those crazy legs kept me
    up all night. JANET: Barry, this is what you want to do with your life? BARRY:
    I want to do it for all our lives. Nobody works harder than bees!  : Dad, I remember
    you coming home so overworked  : your hands were still stirring. You couldn''t
    stop. JANET: I remember that. BARRY: What right do they have to our honey?  :
    We live on two cups a year. They put it in lip balm for no reason whatsoever! 
    ADAM: Even if it''s true, what can one bee do? BARRY: Sting them where it really
    hurts. MARTIN: In the face! The eye!  : - That would hurt. BARRY: - No. MARTIN:
    Up the nose? That''s a killer. BARRY: There''s only one place you can sting the
    humans, one place where it matters. (Flash forward a bit in time and we are watching
    the Bee News) BEE NEWS NARRATOR: Hive at Five, the hive''s only full-hour action
    news source. BEE PROTESTOR: No more bee beards! BEE NEWS NARRATOR: With Bob Bumble
    at the anchor desk.  : Weather with Storm Stinger.  : Sports with Buzz Larvi. 
    : And Jeanette Chung. BOB BUMBLE: - Good evening. I''m Bob Bumble. JEANETTE CHUNG: 
    - And I''m Jeanette Chung. BOB BUMBLE: A tri-county bee, Barry Benson,  : intends
    to sue the human race for stealing our honey,  : packaging it and profiting from
    it illegally! JEANETTE CHUNG: Tomorrow night on Bee Larry King,  : we''ll have
    three former queens here in our studio, discussing their new book,  : Classy
    Ladies, out this week on Hexagon. (The scene changes to an interview on the news
    with Bee version of Larry King and Barry) BEE LARRY KING: Tonight we''re talking
    to Barry Benson.  : Did you ever think, "I''m a kid from the hive. I can''t do
    this"? BARRY: Bees have never been afraid to change the world.  : What about
    Bee Columbus? Bee Gandhi? Bejesus? BEE LARRY KING: Where I''m from, we''d never
    sue humans.   : We were thinking of stickball or candy stores. BARRY: How old
    are you? BEE LARRY KING: The bee community is supporting you in this case,  :
    which will be the trial of the bee century. BARRY: You know, they have a Larry
    King in the human world too. BEE LARRY KING: It''s a common name. Next week...
    BARRY: He looks like you and has a show and suspenders and colored dots... BEE
    LARRY KING: Next week... BARRY: Glasses, quotes on the bottom from the guest
    even though you just heard ''em. BEE LARRY KING: Bear Week next week! They''re
    scary, hairy and here, live. (Bee Larry King gets annoyed and flies away offscreen)
    BARRY: Always leans forward, pointy shoulders, squinty eyes, very Jewish. (Flash
    forward in time. We see Vanessa enter and Ken enters behind her. They are arguing) 
    KEN: In tennis, you attack at the point of weakness! VANESSA: It was my grandmother,
    Ken. She''s 81. KEN== Honey, her backhand''s a joke! I''m not gonna take advantage
    of that? BARRY: (To Ken) Quiet, please. Actual work going on here. KEN: (Pointing
    at Barry) - Is that that same bee? VANESSA: - Yes, it is!  : I''m helping him
    sue the human race. BARRY: - Hello. KEN: - Hello, bee. VANESSA: This is Ken.
    BARRY: (Recalling the "Winter Boots" incident earlier) Yeah, I remember you.
    Timberland, size ten and a half. Vibram sole, I believe. KEN: (To Vanessa) Why
    does he talk again? VANESSA:  Listen, you better go ''cause we''re really busy
    working. KEN: But it''s our yogurt night! VANESSA: (Holding door open for Ken)
    Bye-bye. KEN: (Yelling) Why is yogurt night so difficult?! (Ken leaves and Vanessa
    walks over to Barry. His workplace is a mess) VANESSA: You poor thing. You two
    have been at this for hours! BARRY: Yes, and Adam here has been a huge help.
    ADAM: - Frosting... - How many sugars?  ==BARRY== Just one. I try not to use
    the competition.  : So why are you helping me? VANESSA: Bees have good qualities. 
    : And it takes my mind off the shop.  : Instead of flowers, people are giving
    balloon bouquets now. BARRY:  Those are great, if you''re three. VANESSA: And
    artificial flowers. BARRY: - Oh, those just get me psychotic! VANESSA: - Yeah,
    me too.  : BARRY: Bent stingers, pointless pollination. ADAM: Bees must hate
    those fake things!  : Nothing worse than a daffodil that''s had work done.  :
    Maybe this could make up for it a little bit. VANESSA: - This lawsuit''s a pretty
    big deal. BARRY: - I guess. ADAM: You sure you want to go through with it? BARRY:
    Am I sure? When I''m done with the humans, they won''t be able  : to say, "Honey,
    I''m home," without paying a royalty! (Flash forward in time and we are watching
    the human news. The camera shows  a crowd outside a courthouse) NEWS REPORTER:
    It''s an incredible scene here in downtown Manhattan,  : where the world anxiously
    waits, because for the first time in history,  : we will hear for ourselves if
    a honeybee can actually speak. (We are no longer watching through a news camera)
    ADAM: What have we gotten into here, Barry? BARRY: It''s pretty big, isn''t it?
    ADAM== (Looking at the hundreds of people around the courthouse) I can''t believe
    how many humans don''t work during the day. BARRY: You think billion-dollar multinational
    food companies have good lawyers? SECURITY GUARD: Everybody needs to stay behind
    the barricade. (A limousine drives up and a fat man,Layton Montgomery, a honey
    industry owner gets out and walks past Barry) ADAM: - What''s the matter? BARRY:
    - I don''t know, I just got a chill. (Fast forward in time and everyone is in
    the court) MONTGOMERY: Well, if it isn''t the bee team.  (To Honey Industry lawyers)
    You boys work on this? MAN: All rise! The Honorable Judge Bumbleton presiding.
    JUDGE BUMBLETON: All right. Case number 4475,  : Superior Court of N...'
  - 'NARRATOR: (Black screen with text; The sound of buzzing bees can be heard) According
    to all known laws of aviation,  : there is no way a bee should be able to fly. 
    : Its wings are too small to get its fat little body off the ground.  : The bee,
    of course, flies anyway  : because bees don''t care what humans think is impossible.
    BARRY BENSON: (Barry is picking out a shirt) Yellow, black. Yellow, black. Yellow,
    black. Yellow, black.  : Ooh, black and yellow! Let''s shake it up a little.
    JANET BENSON: Barry! Breakfast is ready! BARRY: Coming!  : Hang on a second.
    (Barry uses his antenna like a phone)  : Hello? ADAM FLAYMAN:  (Through phone)
    - Barry? BARRY: - Adam? ADAM: - Can you believe this is happening? BARRY: - I
    can''t. I''ll pick you up. (Barry flies down the stairs)  : MARTIN BENSON: Looking
    sharp. JANET: Use the stairs. Your father paid good money for those. BARRY: Sorry.
    I''m excited. MARTIN: Here''s the graduate. We''re very proud of you, son.  :
    A perfect report card, all B''s. JANET: Very proud. (Rubs Barry''s hair) BARRY=
    Ma! I got a thing going here. JANET: - You got lint on your fuzz. BARRY: - Ow!
    That''s me!  JANET: - Wave to us! We''ll be in row 118,000. - Bye! (Barry flies
    out the door) JANET: Barry, I told you, stop flying in the house! (Barry drives
    through the hive,and is waved at by Adam who is reading a newspaper) BARRY==
    - Hey, Adam. ADAM: - Hey, Barry. (Adam gets in Barry''s car)  : - Is that fuzz
    gel? BARRY: - A little. Special day, graduation. ADAM: Never thought I''d make
    it. (Barry pulls away from the house and continues driving) BARRY: Three days
    grade school, three days high school... ADAM: Those were awkward. BARRY: Three
    days college. I''m glad I took a day and hitchhiked around the hive. ADAM== You
    did come back different. (Barry and Adam pass by Artie, who is jogging) ARTIE:
    - Hi, Barry!  BARRY: - Artie, growing a mustache? Looks good. ADAM: - Hear about
    Frankie? BARRY: - Yeah. ADAM== - You going to the funeral? BARRY: - No, I''m
    not going to his funeral.  : Everybody knows, sting someone, you die.  : Don''t
    waste it on a squirrel. Such a hothead. ADAM: I guess he could have just gotten
    out of the way. (The car does a barrel roll on the loop-shaped bridge and lands
    on the highway)  : I love this incorporating an amusement park into our regular
    day. BARRY: I guess that''s why they say we don''t need vacations. (Barry parallel
    parks the car and together they fly over the graduating students) Boy, quite
    a bit of pomp... under the circumstances. (Barry and Adam sit down and put on
    their hats)  : - Well, Adam, today we are men.  ADAM: - We are! BARRY= - Bee-men.
    =ADAM= - Amen! BARRY AND ADAM: Hallelujah! (Barry and Adam both have a happy
    spasm) ANNOUNCER: Students, faculty, distinguished bees,  : please welcome Dean
    Buzzwell. DEAN BUZZWELL: Welcome, New Hive Oity graduating class of...  : ...9: 
    : That concludes our ceremonies.  : And begins your career at Honex Industries!
    ADAM: Will we pick our job today? (Adam and Barry get into a tour bus) BARRY=
    I heard it''s just orientation. (Tour buses rise out of the ground and the students
    are automatically loaded into the buses) TOUR GUIDE: Heads up! Here we go.  ANNOUNCER:
    Keep your hands and antennas inside the tram at all times. BARRY: - Wonder what
    it''ll be like? ADAM: - A little scary. TOUR GUIDE== Welcome to Honex, a division
    of Honesco  : and a part of the Hexagon Group. Barry: This is it! BARRY AND ADAM:
    Wow. BARRY: Wow. (The bus drives down a road an on either side are the Bee''s
    massive complicated Honey-making machines) TOUR GUIDE: We know that you, as a
    bee, have worked your whole life  : to get to the point where you can work for
    your whole life.  : Honey begins when our valiant Pollen Jocks bring the nectar
    to the hive.  : Our top-secret formula  : is automatically color-corrected, 
    scent-adjusted and bubble-contoured  : into this soothing sweet syrup  : with
    its distinctive golden glow you know as... EVERYONE ON BUS: Honey! (The guide
    has been collecting honey into a bottle and she throws it into the crowd on the
    bus and it is caught by a girl in the back) ADAM: - That girl was hot. BARRY:
    - She''s my cousin! ADAM== - She is? BARRY: - Yes, we''re all cousins. ADAM:
    - Right. You''re right. TOUR GUIDE: - At Honex, we constantly strive  : to improve
    every aspect of bee existence.  : These bees are stress-testing a new helmet
    technology. (The bus passes by a Bee wearing a helmet who is being smashed into
    the ground with fly-swatters, newspapers and boots. He lifts a thumbs up but
    you can hear him groan)  : ADAM==  - What do you think he makes? BARRY: - Not
    enough. TOUR GUIDE: Here we have our latest advancement, the Krelman. (They pass
    by a turning wheel with Bees standing on pegs, who are each wearing a finger-shaped
    hat) Barry: - Wow, What does that do? TOUR GUIDE: - Catches that little strand
    of honey  : that hangs after you pour it. Saves us millions. ADAM: (Intrigued)
    Can anyone work on the Krelman? TOUR GUIDE: Of course. Most bee jobs are small
    ones. But bees know that every small job, if it''s done well, means a lot.  :
    But choose carefully  : because you''ll stay in the job you pick for the rest
    of your life. (Everyone claps except for Barry) BARRY: The same job the rest
    of your life? I didn''t know that. ADAM:  What''s the difference? TOUR GUIDE:
    You''ll be happy to know that bees, as a species, haven''t had one day off  :
    in 27 million years. BARRY: (Upset) So you''ll just work us to death?  : We''ll
    sure try. (Everyone on the bus laughs except Barry. Barry and Adam are walking
    back home together) ADAM: Wow! That blew my mind! BARRY: "What''s the difference?"
    How can you say that?  : One job forever? That''s an insane choice to have to
    make. ADAM: I''m relieved. Now we only have to make one decision in life. BARRY:
    But, Adam, how could they never have told us that? ADAM: Why would you question
    anything? We''re bees.  : We''re the most perfectly functioning society on Earth. 
    BARRY: You ever think maybe things work a little too well here? ADAM: Like what?
    Give me one example. (Barry and Adam stop walking and it is revealed to the audience
    that hundreds of cars are speeding by and narrowly missing them in perfect unison)
    BARRY: I don''t know. But you know what I''m talking about. ANNOUNCER: Please
    clear the gate. Royal Nectar Force on approach. BARRY: Wait a second. Check it
    out. (The Pollen jocks fly in, circle around and landing in line)  : - Hey, those
    are Pollen Jocks! ADAM: - Wow.  : I''ve never seen them this close. BARRY: They
    know what it''s like outside the hive. ADAM: Yeah, but some don''t come back.
    GIRL BEES: - Hey, Jocks! - Hi, Jocks! (The Pollen Jocks hook up their backpacks
    to machines that pump the nectar to trucks, which drive away)  LOU LO DUVA: You
    guys did great!  : You''re monsters! You''re sky freaks! I love it! (Punching
    the Pollen Jocks in joy) I love it! ADAM: - I wonder where they were. BARRY:
    - I don''t know.  : Their day''s not planned.  : Outside the hive, flying who
    knows where, doing who knows what.  : You can''t just decide to be a Pollen Jock.
    You have to be bred for that. ADAM== Right. (Barry and Adam are covered in some
    pollen that floated off of the Pollen Jocks) BARRY: Look at that. That''s more
    pollen than you and I will see in a lifetime. ADAM: It''s just a status symbol.
    Bees make too much of it. BARRY: Perhaps. Unless you''re wearing it and the ladies
    see you wearing it. (Barry waves at 2 girls standing a little away from them) 
    ADAM== Those ladies? Aren''t they our cousins too? BARRY: Distant. Distant. POLLEN
    JOCK #1: Look at these two. POLLEN JOCK #2: - Couple of Hive Harrys. POLLEN JOCK
    #1: - Let''s have fun with them. GIRL BEE #1: It must be dangerous being a Pollen
    Jock. BARRY: Yeah. Once a bear pinned me against a mushroom!  : He had a paw
    on my throat, and with the other, he was slapping me! (Slaps Adam with his hand
    to represent his scenario) GIRL BEE #2: - Oh, my! BARRY: - I never thought I''d
    knock him out. GIRL BEE #1: (Looking at Adam) What were you doing during this?
    ADAM: Obviously I was trying to alert the authorities. BARRY: I can autograph
    that.  (The pollen jocks walk up to Barry and Adam, they pretend that Barry and
    Adam really are pollen jocks.) POLLEN JOCK #1: A little gusty out there today,
    wasn''t it, comrades? BARRY: Yeah. Gusty. POLLEN JOCK #1: We''re hitting a sunflower
    patch six miles from here tomorrow. BARRY: - Six miles, huh? ADAM: - Barry! POLLEN
    JOCK #2: A puddle jump for us, but maybe you''re not up for it. BARRY: - Maybe
    I am. ADAM: - You are not! POLLEN JOCK #1: We''re going 0900 at J-Gate.  : What
    do you think, buzzy-boy? Are you bee enough? BARRY: I might be. It all depends
    on what 0900 means. (The scene cuts to Barry looking out on the hive-city from
    his balcony at night) MARTIN:  Hey, Honex! BARRY: Dad, you surprised me. MARTIN:
    You decide what you''re interested in? BARRY: - Well, there''s a lot of choices.
    - But you only get one.  : Do you ever get bored doing the same job every day?
    MARTIN: Son, let me tell you about stirring.  : You grab that stick, and you
    just move it around, and you stir it around.  : You get yourself into a rhythm.
    It''s a beautiful thing. BARRY: You know, Dad, the more I think about it,  :
    maybe the honey field just isn''t right for me. MARTIN: You were thinking of
    what, making balloon animals?  : That''s a bad job for a guy with a stinger. 
    :  Janet, your son''s not sure he wants to go into honey! JANET: - Barry, you
    are so funny sometimes. BARRY: - I''m not trying to be funny. MARTIN: You''re
    not funny! You''re going into honey. Our son, the stirrer! JANET: - You''re gonna
    be a stirrer? BARRY: - No one''s listening to me! MARTIN: Wait till you see the
    sticks I have. BARRY: I could say anything right now. I''m gonna get an ant tattoo!
    (Barry''s parents don''t listen to him and continue to ramble on) MARTIN: Let''s
    open some honey and celebrate! BARRY: Maybe I''ll pierce my thorax. Shave my
    antennae.  : Shack up with a grasshopper. Get a gold tooth and call everybody
    "dawg"! JANET: I''m so proud. (The scene cuts to Barry and Adam waiting in line
    to get a job) ADAM: - We''re starting work today!  BARRY: - Today''s the day.
    ADAM: Come on! All the good jobs will be gone. BARRY: Yeah, right. JOB LISTER:
    Pollen counting, stunt bee, pouring, stirrer, front desk, hair removal... BEE
    IN FRONT OF LINE: - Is it still available? JOB LISTER: - Hang on. Two left! 
    : One of them''s yours! Congratulations! Step to the side. ADAM: - What''d you
    get? BEE IN FRONT OF LINE: - Picking crud out. Stellar! (He walks away) ADAM:
    Wow! JOB LISTER: Couple of newbies? ADAM: Yes, sir! Our first day! We are ready!
    JOB LISTER: Make your choice. (Adam and Barry look up at the job board. There
    are hundreds of constantly changing panels that contain available or unavailable
    jobs. It looks very confusing)  ADAM: - You want to go first? BARRY: - No, you
    go. ADAM: Oh, my. What''s available? JOB LISTER: Restroom attendant''s open,
    not for the reason you think. ADAM: - Any chance of getting the Krelman? JOB
    LISTER: - Sure, you''re on. (Puts the Krelman finger-hat on Adam''s head) (Suddenly
    the sign for Krelman closes out)  : I''m sorry, the Krelman just closed out.
    (Takes Adam''s hat off) Wax monkey''s always open. ADAM: The Krelman opened up
    again.  : What happened? JOB LISTER: A bee died. Makes an opening. See? He''s
    dead. Another dead one.  : Deady. Deadified. Two more dead.  : Dead from the
    neck up. Dead from the neck down. That''s life!  ADAM: Oh, this is so hard! (Barry
    remembers what the Pollen Jock offered him and he flies off) Heating, cooling,
    stunt bee, pourer, stirrer,  : humming, inspector number seven, lint coordinator,
    stripe supervisor,  : mite wrangler. Barry, what do you think I should... Barry?
    (Adam turns around and sees Barry flying away)  : Barry! POLLEN JOCK: All right,
    we''ve got the sunflower patch in quadrant nine... ADAM: (Through phone) What
    happened to you? Where are you? BARRY: - I''m going out. ADAM: - Out? Out where?
    BARRY: - Out there. ADAM: - Oh, no! BARRY: I have to, before I go to work for
    the rest of my life. ADAM:  You''re gonna die! You''re crazy! (Barry hangs up)
    Hello? POLLEN JOCK #2: Another call coming in.  : If anyone''s feeling brave,
    there''s a Korean deli on 83rd  : that gets their roses today. BARRY: Hey, guys.
    POLLEN JOCK #1 == - Look at that. POLLEN JOCK #2: - Isn''t that the kid we saw
    yesterday? LOU LO DUVA: Hold it, son, flight deck''s restricted. POLLEN JOCK
    #1: It''s OK, Lou. We''re gonna take him up. (Puts hand on Barry''s shoulder)
    LOU LO DUVA: (To Barry) Really? Feeling lucky, are you? BEE WITH CLIPBOARD: (To
    Barry) Sign here, here. Just initial that.  : - Thank you. LOU LO DUVA: - OK. 
    : You got a rain advisory today,  :  and as you all know, bees cannot fly in
    rain.  : So be careful. As always, watch your brooms,  : hockey sticks, dogs,
    birds, bears and bats.  : Also, I got a couple of reports of root beer being
    poured on us.  : Murphy''s in a home because of it, babbling like a cicada! BARRY:
    - That''s awful. LOU LO DUVA: (Still talking through megaphone) - And a reminder
    for you rookies,  : bee law number one, absolutely no talking to humans!  : All
    right, launch positions! POLLEN JOCKS: (The Pollen Jocks run into formation) 
    : Buzz, buzz, buzz, buzz! Buzz, buzz, buzz, buzz! Buzz, buzz, buzz, buzz! LOU
    LU DUVA: Black and yellow! POLLEN JOCKS:  Hello! POLLEN JOCK #1: (To Barry)You
    ready for this, hot shot? BARRY: Yeah. Yeah, bring it on. POLLEN JOCK''s: Wind,
    check.  : - Antennae, check. - Nectar pack, check.  : - Wings, check. - Stinger,
    check. BARRY: Scared out of my shorts, check. LOU LO DUVA: OK, ladies,  : let''s
    move it out!  : Pound those petunias, you striped stem-suckers!  : All of you,
    drain those flowers! (The pollen jocks fly out of the hive) BARRY: Wow! I''m
    out!  : I can''t believe I''m out!  : So blue.   : I feel so fast and free! 
    : Box kite! (Barry flies through the kite)  : Wow!  : Flowers! (A pollen jock
    puts on some high tech goggles that shows flowers similar to heat sink goggles.)
    POLLEN JOCK: This is Blue Leader. We have roses visual.  : Bring it around 30
    degrees and hold.  : Roses! POLLEN JOCK #1: 30 degrees, roger. Bringing it around. 
    : Stand to the side, kid. It''s got a bit of a kick. (The pollen jock fires a
    high-tech gun at the flower, shooting tubes that suck up the nectar from the
    flower and collects it into a pouch on the gun) BARRY: That is one nectar collector!
    POLLEN JOCK #1== - Ever see pollination up close? BARRY: - No, sir. POLLEN JOCK
    #1:  (Barry and the Pollen jock fly over the field, the pollen jock sprinkles
    pollen as he goes)  : I pick up some pollen here, sprinkle it over here. Maybe
    a dash over there,  : a pinch on that one. See that? It''s a little bit of magic.
    BARRY: That''s amazing. Why do we do that? POLLEN JOCK #1: That''s pollen power.
    More pollen, more flowers, more nectar, more honey for us. BARRY: Cool. POLLEN
    JOCK #1: I''m picking up a lot of bright yellow. could be daisies. Don''t we
    need those? POLLEN JOCK #2: Copy that visual.  : Wait. One of these flowers seems
    to be on the move. POLLEN JOCK #1: Say again? You''re reporting a moving flower?
    POLLEN JOCK #2: Affirmative. (The Pollen jocks land near the "flowers" which,
    to the audience are obviously just tennis balls) KEN: (In the distance) That
    was on the line!  POLLEN JOCK #1: This is the coolest. What is it? POLLEN JOCK
    #2: I don''t know, but I''m loving this color.  : It smells good. Not like a
    flower, but I like it. POLLEN JOCK #1: Yeah, fuzzy. (Sticks his hand on the ball
    but it gets stuck) POLLEN JOCK #3== Chemical-y. (The pollen jock finally gets
    his hand free from the tennis ball) POLLEN JOCK #1: Careful, guys. It''s a little
    grabby. (The pollen jocks turn around and see Barry lying his entire body on
    top of one of the tennis balls) POLLEN JOCK #2: My sweet lord of bees! POLLEN
    JOCK #3: Candy-brain, get off there! POLLEN JOCK #1: (Pointing upwards) Problem!
    (A human hand reaches down and grabs the tennis ball that Barry is stuck to)
    BARRY: - Guys! POLLEN JOCK #2: - This could be bad. POLLEN JOCK #3: Affirmative.
    (Vanessa Bloome starts bouncing the tennis ball, not knowing Barry is stick to
    it)  BARRY== Very close.  : Gonna hurt.  : Mama''s little boy. (Barry is being
    hit back and forth by two humans playing tennis. He is still stuck to the ball)
    POLLEN JOCK #1: You are way out of position, rookie! KEN: Coming in at you like
    a MISSILE! (Barry flies past the pollen jocks, still stuck to the ball) BARRY:
    (In slow motion) Help me! POLLEN JOCK #2: I don''t think these are flowers. POLLEN
    JOCK #3: - Should we tell him? POLLEN JOCK #1: - I think he knows. BARRY: What
    is this?! KEN: Match point!  : You can start packing up, honey, because you''re
    about to EAT IT! (A pollen jock coughs which confused Ken and he hits the ball
    the wrong way with Barry stuck to it and it goes flying into the city) BARRY: 
    Yowser! (Barry bounces around town and gets stuck in the engine of a car. He
    flies into the air conditioner and sees a bug that was frozen in there) BARRY:
    Ew, gross. (The man driving the car turns on the air conditioner which blows
    Barry into the car) GIRL IN CAR: There''s a bee in the car!  : - Do something!
    DAD DRIVING CAR: - I''m driving! BABY GIRL: (Waving at Barry) - Hi, bee. (Barry
    smiles and waves at the baby girl) GUY IN BACK OF CAR: - He''s back here!  :
    He''s going to sting me! GIRL IN CAR: Nobody move. If you don''t move, he won''t
    sting you. Freeze! (Barry freezes as well, hovering in the middle of the car) 
    : GRANDMA IN CAR== He blinked! (The grandma whips out some bee-spray and sprays
    everywhere in the car, climbing into the front seat, still trying to spray Barry)
    GIRL IN CAR: Spray him, Granny! DAD DRIVING THE CAR: What are you doing?! (Barry
    escapes the car through the air conditioner and is flying high above  the ground,
    safe.) BARRY: Wow... the tension level out here is unbelievable. (Barry sees
    that storm clouds are gathering and he can see rain clouds moving into this direction) 
    : I gotta get home.  : Can''t fly in rain.  : Can''t fly in rain. (A rain drop
    hits Barry and one of his wings is damaged)  : Can''t fly in rain. (A second
    rain drop hits Barry again and he spirals downwards) Mayday! Mayday! Bee going
    down! (WW2 plane sound effects are played as he plummets, and he crash-lands
    on a plant inside an apartment near the window) VANESSA BLOOME: Ken, could you
    close the window please? KEN== Hey, check out my new resume. I made it into a
    fold-out brochure.  : You see? (Folds brochure resume out) Folds out. (Ken closes
    the window, trapping Barry inside) BARRY: Oh, no. More humans. I don''t need
    this. (Barry tries to fly away but smashes into the window and falls again) 
    : What was that?  (Barry keeps trying to fly out the window but he keeps being
    knocked back because the window is closed) Maybe this time. This time. This time.
    This time! This time! This...  : Drapes! (Barry taps the glass. He doesn''t understand
    what it is) That is diabolical. KEN: It''s fantastic. It''s got all my special
    skills, even my top-ten favorite movies. ANDY: What''s number one? Star Wars?
    KEN: Nah, I don''t go for that... (Ken makes finger guns and makes "pew pew pew"
    sounds and then stops)  : ...kind of stuff. BARRY: No wonder we shouldn''t talk
    to them. They''re out of their minds. KEN: When I leave a job interview, they''re
    flabbergasted, can''t believe what I say. BARRY: (Looking at the light on the
    ceiling) There''s the sun. Maybe that''s a way out. (Starts flying towards the
    lightbulb)  : I don''t remember the sun having a big 75 on it. (Barry hits the
    lightbulb and falls into the dip on the table that the humans are sitting at)
    KEN:  I predicted global warming.  : I could feel it getting hotter. At first
    I thought it was just me. (Andy dips a chip into the bowl and scoops up some
    dip with Barry on it and is about to put it in his mouth)  : Wait! Stop! Bee!
    (Andy drops the chip with Barry in fear and backs away. All the humans freak
    out)  : Stand back. These are winter boots. (Ken has winter boots on his hands
    and he is about to smash the bee but Vanessa saves him last second) VANESSA:
    Wait!  : Don''t kill him! (Vanessa puts Barry in a glass to protect him) KEN:
    You know I''m allergic to them! This thing could kill me! VANESSA: Why does his
    life have less value than yours? KEN: Why does his life have any less value than
    mine? Is that your statement? VANESSA: I''m just saying all life has value. You
    don''t know what he''s capable of feeling. (Vanessa picks up Ken''s brochure
    and puts it under the glass so she can carry Barry back to the window. Barry
    looks at Vanessa in amazement) KEN:  My brochure! VANESSA: There you go, little
    guy. (Vanessa opens the window and lets Barry out but Barry stays back and is
    still shocked that a human saved his life) KEN: I''m not scared of him. It''s
    an allergic thing. VANESSA: Put that on your resume brochure. KEN: My whole face
    could puff up. ANDY: Make it one of your special skills. KEN: Knocking someone
    out is also a special skill. (Ken walks to the door) Right. Bye, Vanessa. Thanks. 
    : - Vanessa, next week? Yogurt night? VANESSA: - Sure, Ken. You know, whatever. 
    : (Vanessa tries to close door) KEN== - You could put carob chips on there. VANESSA:
    - Bye. (Closes door but Ken opens it again) KEN: - Supposed to be less calories. 
    VANESSA: - Bye. (Closes door) (Fast forward to the next day, Barry is still inside
    the house. He flies into the kitchen where Vanessa is doing dishes) BARRY== (Talking
    to himself) I gotta say something.  : She saved my life. I gotta say something. 
    : All right, here it goes. (Turns back) Nah.  : What would I say?  : I could
    really get in trouble.  : It''s a bee law. You''re not supposed to talk to a
    human.  : I can''t believe I''m doing this.  : I''ve got to. (Barry disguises
    himself as a character on a food can as Vanessa walks by again)  : Oh, I can''t
    do it. Come on!  : No. Yes. No.  : Do it. I can''t.   : How should I start it?
    (Barry strikes a pose and wiggles his eyebrows) "You like jazz?" No, that''s
    no good. (Vanessa is about to walk past Barry) Here she comes! Speak, you fool! 
    : ...Hi! (Vanessa gasps and drops the dishes in fright and notices Barry on the
    counter)  : I''m sorry. VANESSA: - You''re talking. BARRY: - Yes, I know. VANESSA:
    (Pointing at Barry) You''re talking! BARRY: I''m so sorry. VANESSA: No, it''s
    OK. It''s fine. I know I''m dreaming.  : But I don''t recall going to bed. BARRY:
    Well, I''m sure this is very disconcerting. VANESSA: This is a bit of a surprise
    to me. I mean, you''re a bee!  BARRY: I am. And I''m not supposed to be doing
    this, (Pointing to the living room where Ken tried to kill him last night) but
    they were all trying to kill me.  : And if it wasn''t for you...  : I had to
    thank you. It''s just how I was raised. (Vanessa stabs her hand with a fork to
    test whether she''s dreaming or not)  : That was a little weird. VANESSA: - I''m
    talking with a bee. BARRY: - Yeah. VANESSA: I''m talking to a bee. And the bee
    is talking to me! BARRY: I just want to say I''m grateful. I''ll leave now. (Barry
    turns to leave) VANESSA: - Wait! How did you learn to do that? BARRY: (Flying
    back) - What? VANESSA: The talking...thing. BARRY:  Same way you did, I guess.
    "Mama, Dada, honey." You pick it up. VANESSA: - That''s very funny. BARRY: -
    Yeah.  : Bees are funny. If we didn''t laugh, we''d cry with what we have to
    deal with.  : Anyway... VANESSA: Can I...  : ...get you something? BARRY: - Like
    what? VANESSA: I don''t know. I mean... I don''t know. Coffee? BARRY: I don''t
    want to put you out. VANESSA: It''s no trouble. It takes two minutes.  : - It''s
    just coffee. BARRY: - I hate to impose. (Vanessa starts making coffee) VANESSA:
    - Don''t be ridiculous!  BARRY: - Actually, I would love a cup. VANESSA: Hey,
    you want rum cake? BARRY: - I shouldn''t. VANESSA: - Have some. BARRY: - No,
    I can''t. VANESSA: - Come on! BARRY: I''m trying to lose a couple micrograms.
    VANESSA: - Where? BARRY: - These stripes don''t help. VANESSA: You look great!
    BARRY: I don''t know if you know anything about fashion.  : Are you all right?
    VANESSA: (Pouring coffee on the floor and missing the cup completely) No. (Flash
    forward in time. Barry and Vanessa are sitting together at a table on top of
    the apartment building drinking coffee)   : BARRY== He''s making the tie in the
    cab as they''re flying up Madison.  : He finally gets there.  : He runs up the
    steps into the church. The wedding is on.  : And he says, "Watermelon? I thought
    you said Guatemalan.  : Why would I marry a watermelon?" (Barry laughs but Vanessa
    looks confused) VANESSA: Is that a bee joke? BARRY: That''s the kind of stuff
    we do. VANESSA: Yeah, different.  : So, what are you gonna do, Barry? (Barry
    stands on top of a sugar cube floating in his coffee and paddles it around with
    a straw like it''s a gondola) BARRY: About work? I don''t know.  : I want to
    do my part for the hive, but I can''t do it the way they want. VANESSA: I know
    how you feel.  BARRY: - You do? VANESSA: - Sure.  : My parents wanted me to be
    a lawyer or a doctor, but I wanted to be a florist. BARRY: - Really? VANESSA:
    - My only interest is flowers. BARRY: Our new queen was just elected with that
    same campaign slogan.  : Anyway, if you look... (Barry points to a tree in the
    middle of Central Park)  : There''s my hive right there. See it? VANESSA: You''re
    in Sheep Meadow! BARRY: Yes! I''m right off the Turtle Pond! VANESSA: No way!
    I know that area. I lost a toe ring there once. BARRY: - Why do girls put rings
    on their toes? VANESSA: - Why not? BARRY:  - It''s like putting a hat on your
    knee. VANESSA: - Maybe I''ll try that. (A custodian installing a lightbulb looks
    over at them but to his perspective it looks like Vanessa is talking to a cup
    of coffee on the table) CUSTODIAN: - You all right, ma''am? VANESSA: - Oh, yeah.
    Fine.  : Just having two cups of coffee! BARRY: Anyway, this has been great.
    Thanks for the coffee. VANESSA== Yeah, it''s no trouble. BARRY: Sorry I couldn''t
    finish it. If I did, I''d be up the rest of my life. (Barry points towards the
    rum cake)  : Can I take a piece of this with me? VANESSA: Sure! Here, have a
    crumb. (Vanessa hands Barry a crumb but it is still pretty big for Barry) BARRY:
    - Thanks! VANESSA: - Yeah. BARRY: All right. Well, then... I guess I''ll see
    you around.   : Or not. VANESSA: OK, Barry... BARRY: And thank you so much again...
    for before. VANESSA: Oh, that? That was nothing. BARRY: Well, not nothing, but...
    Anyway... (Vanessa and Barry hold hands, but Vanessa has to hold out a finger
    because her hands is to big and Barry holds that) (The custodian looks over again
    and it appears Vanessa is laughing at her coffee again. The lightbulb that he
    was screwing in sparks and he falls off the ladder) (Fast forward in time and
    we see two Bee Scientists testing out a parachute in a Honex wind tunnel) BEE
    SCIENTIST #1: This can''t possibly work. BEE SCIENTIST #2: He''s all set to go.
    We may as well try it.  : OK, Dave, pull the chute. (Dave pulls the chute and
    the wind slams him against the wall and he falls on his face.The camera pans
    over and we see Barry and Adam walking together) ADAM: - Sounds amazing. BARRY:
    - It was amazing!  : It was the scariest, happiest moment of my life.  ADAM:
    Humans! I can''t believe you were with humans!  : Giant, scary humans! What were
    they like? BARRY: Huge and crazy. They talk crazy.  : They eat crazy giant things.
    They drive crazy. ADAM: - Do they try and kill you, like on TV? BARRY: - Some
    of them. But some of them don''t. ADAM: - How''d you get back? BARRY: - Poodle.
    ADAM: You did it, and I''m glad. You saw whatever you wanted to see.  : You had
    your "experience." Now you can pick out your job and be normal. BARRY: - Well...
    ADAM: - Well? BARRY: Well, I met someone.  ADAM: You did? Was she Bee-ish?  :
    - A wasp?! Your parents will kill you! BARRY: - No, no, no, not a wasp. ADAM:
    - Spider? BARRY: - I''m not attracted to spiders.  : I know, for everyone else,
    it''s the hottest thing, with the eight legs and all.  : I can''t get by that
    face. ADAM: So who is she? BARRY: She''s... human. ADAM: No, no. That''s a bee
    law. You wouldn''t break a bee law. BARRY: - Her name''s Vanessa. (Adam puts
    his head in his hands) ADAM: - Oh, boy. BARRY== She''s so nice. And she''s a
    florist! ADAM: Oh, no! You''re dating a human florist!  BARRY: We''re not dating.
    ADAM: You''re flying outside the hive, talking to humans that attack our homes 
    : with power washers and M-80s! That''s one-eighth a stick of dynamite! BARRY:
    She saved my life! And she understands me. ADAM: This is over! BARRY: Eat this.
    (Barry gives Adam a piece of the crumb that he got from Vanessa. Adam eats it)
    ADAM: (Adam''s tone changes) This is not over! What was that? BARRY: - They call
    it a crumb. ADAM: - It was so stingin'' stripey! BARRY: And that''s not what
    they eat. That''s what falls off what they eat!  : - You know what a Cinnabon
    is? ADAM: - No. (Adam opens a door behind him and he pulls Barry in)  BARRY:
    It''s bread and cinnamon and frosting. ADAM: Be quiet! BARRY: They heat it up...
    ADAM: Sit down! (Adam forces Barry to sit down) BARRY: (Still rambling about
    Cinnabons) ...really hot! (Adam grabs Barry by the shoulders) ADAM: - Listen
    to me!  : We are not them! We''re us. There''s us and there''s them! BARRY==
    Yes, but who can deny the heart that is yearning? ADAM: There''s no yearning.
    Stop yearning. Listen to me!  : You have got to start thinking bee, my friend.
    Thinking bee! BARRY: - Thinking bee. WORKER BEE: - Thinking bee. WORKER BEES
    AND ADAM: Thinking bee! Thinking bee!  Thinking bee! Thinking bee! (Flash forward
    in time; Barry is laying on a raft in a pool full of honey. He is wearing sunglasses)
    JANET: There he is. He''s in the pool. MARTIN: You know what your problem is,
    Barry? (Barry pulls down his sunglasses and he looks annoyed) BARRY: (Sarcastic)
    I gotta start thinking bee? JANET: How much longer will this go on? MARTIN: It''s
    been three days! Why aren''t you working? (Puts sunglasses back on) BARRY: I''ve
    got a lot of big life decisions to think about. MARTIN: What life? You have no
    life! You have no job. You''re barely a bee! JANET: Would it kill you to make
    a little honey? (Barry rolls off the raft and sinks into the honey pool)  : Barry,
    come out. Your father''s talking to you.  : Martin, would you talk to him? MARTIN: 
    Barry, I''m talking to you! (Barry keeps sinking into the honey until he is suddenly
    in Central Park having a picnic with Vanessa) (Barry has a cup of honey and he
    clinks his glass with Vanessas. Suddenly a mosquito lands on Vanessa and she
    slaps it, killing it. They both gasp but then burst out laughing) VANESSA: You
    coming? (The camera pans over and Vanessa is climbing into a small yellow airplane)
    BARRY: Got everything? VANESSA: All set! BARRY: Go ahead. I''ll catch up. (Vanessa
    lifts off and flies ahead) VANESSA: Don''t be too long. (Barry catches up with
    Vanessa and he sticks out his arms like ana irplane. He rolls from side to side,
    and Vanessa copies him with the airplane) VANESSA: Watch this! (Barry stays back
    and watches as Vanessa draws a heart in the air using pink smoke from the plane,
    but on the last loop-the-loop she suddenly crashes into a mountain and the plane
    explodes. The destroyed plane falls into some rocks and explodes a second time)
    BARRY: Vanessa! (As Barry is yelling his mouth fills with honey and he wakes
    up, discovering that he was just day dreaming. He slowly sinks back into the
    honey pool) MARTIN: - We''re still here.  JANET: - I told you not to yell at
    him.  : He doesn''t respond to yelling! MARTIN: - Then why yell at me? JANET:
    - Because you don''t listen! MARTIN: I''m not listening to this. BARRY: Sorry,
    I''ve gotta go. MARTIN: - Where are you going? BARRY: - I''m meeting a friend.
    JANET: A girl? Is this why you can''t decide? BARRY: Bye. (Barry flies out the
    door and Martin shakes his head)  : JANET== I just hope she''s Bee-ish. (Fast
    forward in time and Barry is sitting on Vanessa''s shoulder and she is closing
    up her shop) BARRY: They have a huge parade of flowers every year in Pasadena?
    VANESSA: To be in the Tournament of Roses, that''s every florist''s dream!  
    : Up on a float, surrounded by flowers, crowds cheering. BARRY: A tournament.
    Do the roses compete in athletic events? VANESSA: No. All right, I''ve got one.
    How come you don''t fly everywhere? BARRY: It''s exhausting. Why don''t you run
    everywhere? It''s faster. VANESSA: Yeah, OK, I see, I see. All right, your turn.
    BARRY: TiVo. You can just freeze live TV? That''s insane! VANESSA: You don''t
    have that? BARRY: We have Hivo, but it''s a disease. It''s a horrible, horrible
    disease. VANESSA: Oh, my. (A human walks by and Barry narrowly avoids him) PASSERBY:
    Dumb bees! VANESSA: You must want to sting all those jerks. BARRY: We try not
    to sting.  It''s usually fatal for us. VANESSA: So you have to watch your temper
    (They walk into a store) BARRY: Very carefully. You kick a wall, take a walk, 
    : write an angry letter and throw it out. Work through it like any emotion: 
    : Anger, jealousy, lust. (Suddenly an employee(Hector) hits Barry off of Vanessa''s
    shoulder. Hector thinks he''s saving Vanessa) VANESSA: (To Barry) Oh, my goodness!
    Are you OK? (Barry is getting up off the floor) BARRY: Yeah. VANESSA: (To Hector)
    - What is wrong with you?! HECTOR: (Confused) - It''s a bug. VANESSA: He''s not
    bothering anybody. Get out of here, you creep! (Vanessa hits Hector across the
    face with the magazine he had and then hits him in the head. Hector backs away
    covering his head) Barry: What was that? A Pic ''N'' Save circular? (Vanessa
    sets Barry back on her shoulder)  VANESSA: Yeah, it was. How did you know? BARRY:
    It felt like about 10 pages. Seventy-five is pretty much our limit. VANESSA:
    You''ve really got that down to a science. BARRY: - Oh, we have to. I lost a
    cousin to Italian Vogue. VANESSA: - I''ll bet. (Barry looks to his right and
    notices there is honey for sale in the aisle) BARRY: What in the name of Mighty
    Hercules is this? (Barry looks at all the brands of honey, shocked) How did this
    get here? Cute Bee, Golden Blossom,  : Ray Liotta Private Select? (Barry puts
    his hands up and slowly turns around, a look of disgust on his face) VANESSA:
    - Is he that actor? BARRY: - I never heard of him.  : - Why is this here? VANESSA:
    - For people. We eat it. BARRY:  You don''t have enough food of your own?! (Hector
    looks back and notices that Vanessa is talking to Barry) VANESSA: - Well, yes.
    BARRY: - How do you get it? VANESSA: - Bees make it. BARRY: - I know who makes
    it!  : And it''s hard to make it!  : There''s heating, cooling, stirring. You
    need a whole Krelman thing! VANESSA: - It''s organic. BARRY: - It''s our-ganic!
    VANESSA: It''s just honey, Barry. BARRY: Just what?!  : Bees don''t know about
    this! This is stealing! A lot of stealing!  : You''ve taken our homes, schools,
    hospitals! This is all we have!  :  And it''s on sale?! I''m getting to the bottom
    of this.  : I''m getting to the bottom of all of this! (Flash forward in time;
    Barry paints his face with black strikes like a soldier and sneaks into the storage
    section of the store) (Two men, including Hector, are loading boxes into some
    trucks)  : SUPERMARKET EMPLOYEE== Hey, Hector.  : - You almost done? HECTOR:
    - Almost. (Barry takes a step to peak around the corner) (Whispering) He is here.
    I sense it.  : Well, I guess I''ll go home now (Hector pretends to walk away
    by walking in place and speaking loudly)  : and just leave this nice honey out,
    with no one around. BARRY: You''re busted, box boy! HECTOR: I knew I heard something!
    So you can talk! BARRY: I can talk. And now you''ll start talking!  : Where you
    getting the sweet stuff?  Who''s your supplier? HECTOR: I don''t understand.
    I thought we were friends.  : The last thing we want to do is upset bees! (Hector
    takes a thumbtack out of the board behind him and sword-fights Barry. Barry is
    using his stinger like a sword)  : You''re too late! It''s ours now! BARRY: You,
    sir, have crossed the wrong sword! HECTOR: You, sir, will be lunch for my iguana,
    Ignacio! (Barry hits the thumbtack out of Hectors hand and Hector surrenders)
    Barry: Where is the honey coming from?  : Tell me where! HECTOR: (Pointing to
    leaving truck) Honey Farms! It comes from Honey Farms! (Barry chases after the
    truck but it is getting away. He flies onto a bicyclists'' backpack and he catches
    up to the truck) CAR DRIVER: (To bicyclist) Crazy person! (Barry flies off and
    lands on the windshield of the Honey farms truck. Barry looks around and sees
    dead bugs splattered everywhere) BARRY: What horrible thing has happened here?  
    : These faces, they never knew what hit them. And now  : they''re on the road
    to nowhere! (Barry hears a sudden whisper) (Barry looks up and sees Mooseblood,
    a mosquito playing dead) MOOSEBLOOD: Just keep still. BARRY: What? You''re not
    dead? MOOSEBLOOD: Do I look dead? They will wipe anything that moves. Where you
    headed? BARRY: To Honey Farms. I am onto something huge here. MOOSEBLOOD: I''m
    going to Alaska. Moose blood, crazy stuff. Blows your head off! ANOTHER BUG PLAYING
    DEAD: I''m going to Tacoma. (Barry looks at another bug) BARRY: - And you? MOOSEBLOOD:
    - He really is dead. BARRY: All right. (Another bug hits the windshield and the
    drivers notice. They activate the windshield wipers) MOOSEBLOOD== Uh-oh! (The
    windshield wipers are slowly sliding over the dead bugs and wiping  them off)
    BARRY: - What is that?! MOOSEBLOOD: - Oh, no!  : - A wiper! Triple blade! BARRY:
    - Triple blade? MOOSEBLOOD: Jump on! It''s your only chance, bee! (Mooseblood
    and Barry grab onto the wiper and they hold on as it wipes the windshield) Why
    does everything have to be so doggone clean?!  : How much do you people need
    to see?! (Bangs on windshield)  : Open your eyes! Stick your head out the window!
    RADIO IN TRUCK: From NPR News in Washington, I''m Carl Kasell. MOOSEBLOOD: But
    don''t kill no more bugs! (Mooseblood and Barry are washed off by the wipr fluid)
    MOOSEBLOOD: - Bee! BARRY: - Moose blood guy!! (Barry starts screaming as he hangs
    onto the antenna) (Suddenly it is revealed that a water bug is also hanging on
    the antenna.  There is a pause and then Barry and the water bug both start screaming)
    TRUCK DRIVER: - You hear something? GUY IN TRUCK: - Like what? TRUCK DRIVER:
    Like tiny screaming. GUY IN TRUCK: Turn off the radio. (The antenna starts to
    lower until it gets to low and sinks into the truck. The water bug flies off
    and Barry is forced to let go and he is blown away. He luckily lands inside a
    horn on top of the truck where he finds Mooseblood, who was blown into the same
    place) MOOSEBLOOD: Whassup, bee boy? BARRY: Hey, Blood. (Fast forward in time
    and we see that Barry is deep in conversation with Mooseblood. They have been
    sitting in this truck for a while) BARRY: ...Just a row of honey jars, as far
    as the eye could see. MOOSEBLOOD: Wow! BARRY: I assume wherever this truck goes
    is where they''re getting it.  : I mean, that honey''s ours. MOOSEBLOOD: - Bees
    hang tight. BARRY:  - We''re all jammed in.  : It''s a close community. MOOSEBLOOD:
    Not us, man. We on our own. Every mosquito on his own. BARRY: - What if you get
    in trouble? MOOSEBLOOD: - You a mosquito, you in trouble.  : Nobody likes us.
    They just smack. See a mosquito, smack, smack! BARRY: At least you''re out in
    the world. You must meet girls. MOOSEBLOOD: Mosquito girls try to trade up, get
    with a moth, dragonfly.  : Mosquito girl don''t want no mosquito. (An ambulance
    passes by and it has a blood donation sign on it) You got to be kidding me! 
    : Mooseblood''s about to leave the building! So long, bee! (Mooseblood leaves
    and flies onto the window of the ambulance where there are other mosquito''s
    hanging out)  : - Hey, guys! OTHER MOSQUITO: - Mooseblood!  MOOSEBLOOD: I knew
    I''d catch y''all down here. Did you bring your crazy straw? (The truck goes
    out of view and Barry notices that the truck he''s on is pulling into a camp
    of some sort) TRUCK DRIVER: We throw it in jars, slap a label on it, and it''s
    pretty much pure profit. (Barry flies out) BARRY: What is this place? BEEKEEPER
    1#: A bee''s got a brain the size of a pinhead. BEEKEEPER #2: They are pinheads! 
    : Pinhead.  : - Check out the new smoker. BEEKEEPER #1: - Oh, sweet. That''s
    the one you want.  : The Thomas 3000! BARRY: Smoker? BEEKEEPER #1: Ninety puffs
    a minute, semi-automatic. Twice the nicotine, all the tar.  : A couple breaths
    of this knocks them right out.  BEEKEEPER #2: They make the honey, and we make
    the money. BARRY: "They make the honey, and we make the money"? (The Beekeeper
    sprays hundreds of cheap miniature apartments with the smoker. The bees are fainting
    or passing out) Oh, my!  : What''s going on? Are you OK? (Barry flies into one
    of the apartment and helps a Bee couple get off the ground. They are coughing
    and its hard for them to stand) BEE IN APARTMENT: Yeah. It doesn''t last too
    long. BARRY: Do you know you''re in a fake hive with fake walls? BEE IN APPARTMENT:
    Our queen was moved here. We had no choice. (The apartment room is completely
    empty except for a photo on the wall of the "queen" who is obviously a man in
    women''s clothes) BARRY: This is your queen? That''s a man in women''s clothes! 
    : That''s a drag queen!  : What is this? (Barry flies out and he discovers that
    there are hundreds of these structures, each housing thousands of Bees) Oh, no! 
    : There''s hundreds of them! (Barry takes out his camera and takes pictures of
    these Bee work camps. The beekeepers look very evil in these depictions)  Bee
    honey.  : Our honey is being brazenly stolen on a massive scale!  : This is worse
    than anything bears have done! I intend to do something. (Flash forward in time
    and Barry is showing these pictures to his parents) JANET: Oh, Barry, stop. MARTIN:
    Who told you humans are taking our honey? That''s a rumor. BARRY: Do these look
    like rumors? (Holds up the pictures) UNCLE CARL: That''s a conspiracy theory.
    These are obviously doctored photos. JANET: How did you get mixed up in this?
    ADAM: He''s been talking to humans. JANET: - What? MARTIN: - Talking to humans?!
    ADAM: He has a human girlfriend. And they make out! JANET: Make out? Barry! 
    BARRY: We do not. ADAM: - You wish you could. MARTIN: - Whose side are you on?
    BARRY: The bees! UNCLE CARL: (He has been sitting in the back of the room this
    entire time) I dated a cricket once in San Antonio. Those crazy legs kept me
    up all night. JANET: Barry, this is what you want to do with your life? BARRY:
    I want to do it for all our lives. Nobody works harder than bees!  : Dad, I remember
    you coming home so overworked  : your hands were still stirring. You couldn''t
    stop. JANET: I remember that. BARRY: What right do they have to our honey?  :
    We live on two cups a year. They put it in lip balm for no reason whatsoever! 
    ADAM: Even if it''s true, what can one bee do? BARRY: Sting them where it really
    hurts. MARTIN: In the face! The eye!  : - That would hurt. BARRY: - No. MARTIN:
    Up the nose? That''s a killer. BARRY: There''s only one place you can sting the
    humans, one place where it matters. (Flash forward a bit in time and we are watching
    the Bee News) BEE NEWS NARRATOR: Hive at Five, the hive''s only full-hour action
    news source. BEE PROTESTOR: No more bee beards! BEE NEWS NARRATOR: With Bob Bumble
    at the anchor desk.  : Weather with Storm Stinger.  : Sports with Buzz Larvi. 
    : And Jeanette Chung. BOB BUMBLE: - Good evening. I''m Bob Bumble. JEANETTE CHUNG: 
    - And I''m Jeanette Chung. BOB BUMBLE: A tri-county bee, Barry Benson,  : intends
    to sue the human race for stealing our honey,  : packaging it and profiting from
    it illegally! JEANETTE CHUNG: Tomorrow night on Bee Larry King,  : we''ll have
    three former queens here in our studio, discussing their new book,  : Classy
    Ladies, out this week on Hexagon. (The scene changes to an interview on the news
    with Bee version of Larry King and Barry) BEE LARRY KING: Tonight we''re talking
    to Barry Benson.  : Did you ever think, "I''m a kid from the hive. I can''t do
    this"? BARRY: Bees have never been afraid to change the world.  : What about
    Bee Columbus? Bee Gandhi? Bejesus? BEE LARRY KING: Where I''m from, we''d never
    sue humans.   : We were thinking of stickball or candy stores. BARRY: How old
    are you? BEE LARRY KING: The bee community is supporting you in this case,  :
    which will be the trial of the bee century. BARRY: You know, they have a Larry
    King in the human world too. BEE LARRY KING: It''s a common name. Next week...
    BARRY: He looks like you and has a show and suspenders and colored dots... BEE
    LARRY KING: Next week... BARRY: Glasses, quotes on the bottom from the guest
    even though you just heard ''em. BEE LARRY KING: Bear Week next week! They''re
    scary, hairy and here, live. (Bee Larry King gets annoyed and flies away offscreen)
    BARRY: Always leans forward, pointy shoulders, squinty eyes, very Jewish. (Flash
    forward in time. We see Vanessa enter and Ken enters behind her. They are arguing) 
    KEN: In tennis, you attack at the point of weakness! VANESSA: It was my grandmother,
    Ken. She''s 81. KEN== Honey, her backhand''s a joke! I''m not gonna take advantage
    of that? BARRY: (To Ken) Quiet, please. Actual work going on here. KEN: (Pointing
    at Barry) - Is that that same bee? VANESSA: - Yes, it is!  : I''m helping him
    sue the human race. BARRY: - Hello. KEN: - Hello, bee. VANESSA: This is Ken.
    BARRY: (Recalling the "Winter Boots" incident earlier) Yeah, I remember you.
    Timberland, size ten and a half. Vibram sole, I believe. KEN: (To Vanessa) Why
    does he talk again? VANESSA:  Listen, you better go ''cause we''re really busy
    working. KEN: But it''s our yogurt night! VANESSA: (Holding door open for Ken)
    Bye-bye. KEN: (Yelling) Why is yogurt night so difficult?! (Ken leaves and Vanessa
    walks over to Barry. His workplace is a mess) VANESSA: You poor thing. You two
    have been at this for hours! BARRY: Yes, and Adam here has been a huge help.
    ADAM: - Frosting... - How many sugars?  ==BARRY== Just one. I try not to use
    the competition.  : So why are you helping me? VANESSA: Bees have good qualities. 
    : And it takes my mind off the shop.  : Instead of flowers, people are giving
    balloon bouquets now. BARRY:  Those are great, if you''re three. VANESSA: And
    artificial flowers. BARRY: - Oh, those just get me psychotic! VANESSA: - Yeah,
    me too.  : BARRY: Bent stingers, pointless pollination. ADAM: Bees must hate
    those fake things!  : Nothing worse than a daffodil that''s had work done.  :
    Maybe this could make up for it a little bit. VANESSA: - This lawsuit''s a pretty
    big deal. BARRY: - I guess. ADAM: You sure you want to go through with it? BARRY:
    Am I sure? When I''m done with the humans, they won''t be able  : to say, "Honey,
    I''m home," without paying a royalty! (Flash forward in time and we are watching
    the human news. The camera shows  a crowd outside a courthouse) NEWS REPORTER:
    It''s an incredible scene here in downtown Manhattan,  : where the world anxiously
    waits, because for the first time in history,  : we will hear for ourselves if
    a honeybee can actually speak. (We are no longer watching through a news camera)
    ADAM: What have we gotten into here, Barry? BARRY: It''s pretty big, isn''t it?
    ADAM== (Looking at the hundreds of people around the courthouse) I can''t believe
    how many humans don''t work during the day. BARRY: You think billion-dollar multinational
    food companies have good lawyers? SECURITY GUARD: Everybody needs to stay behind
    the barricade. (A limousine drives up and a fat man,Layton Montgomery, a honey
    industry owner gets out and walks past Barry) ADAM: - What''s the matter? BARRY:
    - I don''t know, I just got a chill. (Fast forward in time and everyone is in
    the court) MONTGOMERY: Well, if it isn''t the bee team.  (To Honey Industry lawyers)
    You boys work on this? MAN: All rise! The Honorable Judge Bumbleton presiding.
    JUDGE BUMBLETON: All right. Case number 4475,  : Superior Court of N...'
